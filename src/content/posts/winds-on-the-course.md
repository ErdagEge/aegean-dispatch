The coastal trail near the house is a study in microclimates. One direction is a tailwind and a chorus of gulls, the other is an unexpected hill and a headwind that feels personal. It is the perfect reminder that pacing is part stubbornness, part humility.

The best gear I added this year was not carbon shoes but an old-school wristwatch. It tells me only elapsed time and frees me from thinking about pace until the run is over. Simplicity is underrated in sport too.
