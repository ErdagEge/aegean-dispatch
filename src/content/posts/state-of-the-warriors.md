The Golden State Warriors dropped a game against the Heat. The Warriors had a pretty depleted squad result of a pretty tough schedule. Even Steve Kerr described it as "... the toughest early schedule I've ever been a part of in my entire NBA life."

But even with logical excuses; the Warriors need to be less reliant on Curry if they are serious about a playoff push this year.
