I spent most of the month drifting between repertory theaters and new releases. A late-night revival of *In the Mood for Love* reminded me how color can hum like a soundtrack. Wong Kar-wai's restless camera still feels like the inside of a daydream.

On the flight home I reread Maggie Nelson's *The Argonauts*. The book's clipped, crystalline paragraphs felt like the right counter-weight to a string of languid films. If September had a shape, it would be a slow tracking shot: patient, curious, and dissolved in neon.
